This project uses a dataset of China's 新闻联播 articles to train a model to predict whether or not an article will be about Xi Jinping. This can be useful to track whether Chinese media puts out an increased number of articles reflecting Xi Jinping in a good light around times when he is potentially acting in ways that the populace may see as negative.
